#### Getting started with my project ####

Run ```npm install``` to install all the node packages from the project directory.
Run ```npm run build-db``` to create the database (database.db).
Run ```npm run start``` to start serving the web app.

Once the app is running, 
http://localhost:3000/author/home
will allow us to access the author home page, while
http://localhost:3000/user/home
will allow us to access the user home page.
